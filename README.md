About the company
In 2016, Cyclists launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders

TASK:
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

Case study was solved by following the steps in the course:

1 ASK: Getting end-to-end requirements of the problem statement
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

2 PREPARE: Verifying data integrity, reliability and data types, and consistency( merging)
